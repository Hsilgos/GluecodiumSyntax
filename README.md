# GluecodiumSyntax

[Gluecodium](https://github.com/heremaps/gluecodium) is open sources project which generates code to connect *Java*, *Swift* and *Dart* to *C++*. The main focus is *Android* and *iOS* but *MacOS* and *Linux* are supported as well. Gluecodium parses input files where entities are described in special language which is called `LimeIDL`. This package provides syntax highlighting for this language.
